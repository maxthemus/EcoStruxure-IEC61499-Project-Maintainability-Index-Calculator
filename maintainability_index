Maintainability Index = MI

Components:
Halstead's Volume - HV
Cyclomatic Complexity - CC
Lines of Code - LOC 
% of Comments perCOM

Formula
Maintainability = 171 - 5.2 * ln(HV) - 0.23 * CC - 16.2 * ln(LOC)


Halstead Volume:
HV = (Total Operators + Total Operands) * log(_2){({Unique Operators + Unique Operands})

Cyclomatic Complexity:
v(G) = N(edges) - N(nodes) + 2
- Counts edges and nodes in ECC of FB

In ECC to operator == Algorithm on state || a transition that isn't always true (EG 1)
There are Unique operators and non unique operators

Operand = condition of a transition || (Algorithm || Output Event


To calculate HV for composite block sum all HV values of internet FB and divide by number of FB's
